Title:
Predictive Modeling of Intergenerational Income

Summary:
We want to know what the income of a third generation American is based on personal and familial demographics? The American Dream is a concept that anyone, regardless of where they come from can achieve success and increase their economic status through their hard work. We were tasked to provide predictions of American citizen's income using their education opportunities, family income, and other demographic data to promote the American Dream all over the globe.

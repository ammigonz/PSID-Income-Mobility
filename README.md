###Predictive Modeling of Intergenerational Income

## Summary:
In my final year of undergrad at UC Santa Cruz, I took a class called Machine Learning for Economists. At this time I was already interested in Data Science, but had only Econometrics classes under my belt as an Economics major. Working on this project showed me that there was a possibility of applying myself in the world of Data and Analytics, 
We want to know what the income of a third generation American is based on personal and familial demographics? The American Dream is a concept that anyone, regardless of where they come from can achieve success and increase their economic status through their hard work. We were tasked to provide predictions of American citizen's income using their education opportunities, family income, and other demographic data to promote the American Dream all over the globe.

# PSID-Income-Mobility
### Predictive Modeling of Intergenerational Income
Analyzed income mobility for the Panel Study of Income Dynamics dataset by building predictive models that leveraged demographic and familial variables. Conducted model selection in R of OLS, Lasso, and Ridge regressions through cross-validation and interaction terms to improve out-of-sample R². Visualized insights on the role of education and income mobility, highlighting predictive effects of educational attainment and intergenerational affluence.

## Summary:
In my final year of undergrad at UC Santa Cruz, I took a class called Machine Learning for Economists. At this time I was already interested in Data Science, but had only Econometrics classes under my belt as an Economics major. Working on this project opened the door for me to pursue my passion for data and econometrics. The question I sought to answer is that of Generational Wealth and the american dream, an idea close to many of us.

Here I study the Panel Study of Income Dynamics dataset and want to know whether the income of a third generation American is based on personal and familial demographics? The American Dream is a concept that anyone, regardless of where they come from can achieve success and increase their economic status through their hard work. I analyzed income mobility by building predictive models that leveraged demographic and familial variables such as their education opportunities and family income. I conducted model selection in R of OLS, Lasso, and Ridge regressions through cross-validation and interaction terms to improve out-of-sample R². Finally the visualizations in my paper show insights on the role of education and income mobility, highlighting predictive effects of educational attainment and intergenerational affluence.

## Installation:
This is very simple, I only have one R file and one CSV. The CSV can be found here:
https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/185941/version/V2/view?path=/openicpsr/185941/fcr:versions/V2/for_students.zip&type=file

## Usage: 
Download the csv above and replace my directory with yours
and the code will run smothly
